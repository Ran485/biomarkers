# Phenotype list curation

We had [list of 173 phenotypes](https://github.com/rivas-lab/biomarkers/blob/0941c161391532d3bc899c8210714458402c8f63/phewas/phenotypes.txt).

In summer 2020, we went through the list again and decided to remove the following phenotypes (due to duplicate and deprecated phenotype endpoints).

```
RH141
BIN_FC1006152
RH110
RH130
HC308
HC198
```
