```{bash}
ml load circos
# ml load R

cd ~/repos/rivas-lab/biomarkers/fuji_plot
Rscript ~/repos/yk-tanigawa/fujiplot/fujiplot.R fuji.input.tsv traitlist.tsv . && bash 3_post_process.svg.sh circos.svg Fuji.svg

```

Fuji plot is generated by calling a folked version of Masa's Fuji plot.
It is a R script that calls circos, which itself is a Perl script that internally calls GD potting library (in C) via its Perl interface.

The resulting files are in both png and svg format. We apply post-processing script on svg to update the font settings.

After that, we use Illustrator to add labels, legends, etc.
