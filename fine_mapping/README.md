# Fine-mapping

To generate the figure for the fine-mapping analysis, we used the following scripts:

1. `parseFinemapOutputForFigure3.r`
2. `plotFinemapFigure3.ipynb` (this is the same content as in `plotFinemapFigure3.r`)

The results are saved and copied to the Google Drive shared folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i6w0qQRfrv-vEi7NIMh2yoSsCgTYtdE-
